This add-on controls loading of content of IFRAME elements (and FRAME). The typical regime:
  * rejects a content that is designed by an author of html page.
  * The virtual content will be a link to a frame's address or,
  * if a case for browsers that do not support FRAME elements is provided it will be used.
  * The next set of the protocols are always rejected: **data**, **ftp**, **mailto**, **news**.
